# Verilog Flip-Flop Implementations

This repository contains Verilog source code for fundamental digital logic circuits. The primary example is a D-type flip-flop, which serves as a basic memory element in digital systems.

This project demonstrates how to write a simple synthesizable module and an accompanying testbench to verify its functionality. It is intended for those learning digital design with Verilog.

## Flip-Flops Implemented
Based on the provided files, the repository structure focuses on documenting different flip-flop types:
*   **SR-Flipflop**
*   **D-Flipflop**
*   **JK-Flipflop**
*   **T-Flipflop**

## File Structure
The project directory is organized to hold explanations for each flip-flop type:
